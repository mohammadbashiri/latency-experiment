# VRLatency


### What is it?

The aim of this project is to build a simple device, and provide very simple code
to enable researchers to characterize the performance of their Virtual Reality (VR) system.

In this project we have tried to keep the hardware as simple, and cheap, as possible.
The device used for this project is arduino uno.

Below you will find some figures on how we are using this device to characterize the latency
of our VR system.

[This description will be updated as the project progresses..]

### Some results

[add pictures from oscilloscope as well as the output of the device..]
